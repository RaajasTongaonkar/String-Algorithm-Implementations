# Dice's Coefficient
Also called SÃ¸rensen index.

Given two strings, calculate first all the bigrams each has. Then find the number of bigrams common to both. Dice's coefficient is given by

DSC = 2*|X intersection Y|/(|X| + |Y|),

where X and Y are the collections of bigrams of the two words.

## The code
Run Dice's coefficient.py and enter two strings. The other two codes contains functions for generating bigrams for a word and for finding common elements between two lists.
